# Project 1, Iteration 3: Titles and Animation
A game framework by Jordan Demske.

This is a multi-part project in which I will build a 2D physics-based action game along the lines of Angry Birds. This iteration will focus on sounds and graphics. Future parts will build upon this to improve player experience.

### Controls:
- UP-arrow/W and DOWN-arrow/S keys control launch angle
- LEFT/RIGHT-arrows control launch power
- SPACEBAR launches character

## Project Report

Reflection: This iterations goals were interesting. They focused less on the functionality of godot, and more on polish/formatting existing code. I went for a B, because I want to balance my course load. I would liked to have gone for an A, but I didn't think it was reasonable at the time. I will go back through on my own time and work through the remaining checks for this iteration most likely this coming weekend, after I turn in a few other projects.

Self Evaluation:

- [x] D-1: The repository link is submitted to Canvas before the project deadline.
- [x] D-2: The repository contains a <code>README.md</code> file in its top-level directory.
- [x] D-3: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of M or less.
- [x] C-1: Your repository is well-formed, with an appropriate <code>.gitignore</code> file and no unnecessary files tracked.
- [x] C-2: Your release is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, and the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
- [x] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, and the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the <code>README.md</code> file.
- [x] C-4: The <code>README.md</code> contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game itself.
- [x] C-5: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of T or less.
- [x] C-6: The game starts on a title screen. Interacting with the title screen moves the player into the gameplay screen.
- [x] B-1: The <code>README.md</code> file contains a personal reflection on the iteration and self-evaluation, as defined above.
- [x] B-2: Earn one star.
- [ ] A-1: Generate neither warnings nor errors at runtime.
- [ ] A-2: Earn three stars.
- [ ] ⭐ When the game is over, the player can interact to take the game back to the title screen, from which the game can be played again.
- [x] ⭐ Use an <code>AnimationPlayer</code> or <code>Tween</code> to add some pop to the user-interface.
- [ ] ⭐ The source code complies with our adopted style guide.



Grade Earned:

I believe that this project has earned a grade of _B_ in accordance with the required documentation and functionality.
