# Project 1, Iteration 2: Graphics and Sound
A game framework by Jordan Demske.

This is a multi-part project in which I will build a 2D physics-based action game along the lines of Angry Birds. This iteration will focus on sounds and graphics. Future parts will build upon this to improve player experience.

### Controls:
- UP-arrow/W and DOWN-arrow/S keys control launch angle
- LEFT/RIGHT-arrows control launch power
- SPACEBAR launches character

## Project Report

Reflection: I'm glad to be working in this engine, and this project. I've wanted to make my own games for a while, and this seems like the perfect place to start. The software makes it easy to impliment audio, graphics, and objects, many of which I know how to make custom assets for. The lessons I'm learning right now will help me to make my own projects later on, and that makes me very happy.
