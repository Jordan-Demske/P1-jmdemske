# Project 1, Iteration 1: 2D Physics-Based Gameplay
A game framework by Jordan Demske.

This is the first of a multi-part project in which I will build a 2D physics-based action game along the lines of Angry Birds. This iteration will focus on the core physics-based gameplay. Future parts will build upon this to improve player experience.

### Controls:
- Left and Right arrow keys control launch angle
- Spacebar launches main character.

## Project Report
(Project report goes here)

Reflection:

Self Evaluation:

- [x] D-1: The repository link is submitted to Canvas before the project deadline.
- [x] D-2: The repository contains a <code>README.md</code> file in its top-level directory.
- [x] D-3: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of M or less.
- [x] C-1: Your repository is well-formed, with an appropriate <code>.gitignore</code> file and no unnecessary files tracked.
- [x] C-2: Your release is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, and the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
- [x] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, and the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the <code>README.md</code> file.
- [x] C-4: The <code>README.md</code> contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game itself.
- [x] C-5: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of T or less.
- [x] C-6: The player can control the angle at which the projectile is fired.
- [x] C-7: The player can fire the projectile.
- [x] C-8: The projectile's flight is affected by gravity using Godot Engine's physics system.
- [x] C-9: There is a &ldquo;ground&rdquo; that stops the projectile.
- [ ] C-10: There is a non-ground target that the projectile can hit.
- [ ] B-1: The <code>README.md</code> file contains a personal reflection on the iteration and self-evaluation, as defined above.
- [ ] B-2: The projectile's firing angle is clamped between 0&deg; (straight forward) and 90&deg; (straight up).
- [ ] A-1: The player can modify the strength of the projectile's firing.
- [ ] A-2: There is a visual indicator showing the angle at which the projectile will fire.
- [ ] A-3: The projectile's hitting the target is recognized and logged to the console or otherwise indicated.

I believe that this project has earned a grade of ___ in accordance with the required documentation and functionality.
